## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**WelbeckKW/WelbeckKW** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own digital portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create a website
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on future UI design projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with expanding beyond GitHub
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my coding experience!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: welbeckkezia@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I first started off at Snap!
